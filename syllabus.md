#### CIN430H1-F19: Advanced Study in Cinema as Social and Cultural Practice

# Everything is Terrible
## Or, The Good Life

### Land acknowledgment
We acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.

Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

### Course description
Over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, a great many critics have despaired at the damage new media technologies do to our individual lives and to our collective life. The other side of this complaint is the promise of such new media technologies to offer more pleasurable, more optimistic, or simply better ways of living. This course tracks both sides of this dialectic historically and theoretically, in the hope of better understanding our contemporary entanglements in toxic media environments and cultures. To that end, we will pay particular attention to the recent burst of critical (and not-so-critical) writing about social media and internet use. Throughout, our focus will be less on the theoretical agendas of media critics than on the way theory can inform our sense of practical problems and prospects for better living; our reading will range across scholarly, pop-intellectual, and journalistic work. Our reading will be bookended by Theodor Adorno’s 1951 _Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life_ and James Bridle’s 2018 _New Dark Age_. Screenings and aesthetic texts will range widely across media and genres, including films, video art, literature, internet art, conceptual art, and video games.

### How this course is taught
This course pulls together a number of texts, films, artworks, and other objects that I have found useful for setting into focus and then describing the present conjuncture—of art, politics, culture, ordinary life, media technologies. And, living inside this present conjuncture feels really bad. This class represents an earnest attempt to figure out how, and why, and what we might do to (and what I might do myself to) negotiate a less awful relationship to our media, which are at this point all digital and networked. 

I do not mean for the material I have pulled together to be exhaustive, and certainly not authoritative. The core critical intuition of this course is that none of us, not one (and especially not me), has a privileged position to address the current conjuncture. That does not, however, absolve any of us (not one, and especially not me) from working to reckon with it. Because of that, this course will be rather more democratically driven than you are probably used to. At various critical moments in the course, we will ask ourselves whether what we have in front of us feels right, and whether we might want to pursue different kinds of questions, engage in different kinds of inquiry.

Because of all this, this course is decisively discussion-based, organized around student engagement with the material, and with each other. In other words, the way I understand my role here is to produce an occasion for all of us together to have a thought about our shared present, and also our _unshared_ present, and the ways in which media technologies articulate those presents.

#### Discussions
The primary pedagogical activity this term will be group discussions. These discussions will be structured: each week, we will pose questions; use think-pair-share to lean into the question; collect some responses and observations; have a general discussion; and then reflect on the course of the discussion. We will have one or two of these per week, depending on the material we have at hand. This means that students **must** come with the reading carefully prepared each week, **and** with a playful willingness to reckon with the material collaboratively.

#### Group activities
In addition to discussions, most weeks we will also have a structured group activity that allows us to open up our questions in different registers than straightforward readings. In addition, these group activities will sometimes ask students to do “homework” in the ensuing week, with additional class time dedicated to addressing the results of that homework.

### Outcomes
The “outcomes” here stem from the same commiments as the pedagogical process. The learning activities in this coure are organized around encouraging students to do the following:
* To think, and think well, when it’s not clear how to proceed
* To develop tolerance for ambiguity and, especially, uncertainty
* To develop skills for lateral thinking, drawing figures of thought from one domain into another
* To ask good questions (for some definition of “good”)
* To drive learning through engagement with intellectual problems
* To organize engagement with course material around what we don’t know rather than what we do
* To unravel attachments to mastery
* To have vulnerable discussions
* To develop analytical, aesthetic, and conceptual skills with media other than film
* To trust process, not outcome

### Coursework
The coursework is divided in two different streams: (1) in-class & activity participation, and (2) a major project.

#### Major project
The major project will be completely bespoke: what you do will be _entirely_ up to you, so long as it is within the horizons of the course. You will devise your own problem, and your own methods of responding to that problem. All parameters are to be determined (in one of our group activities), but your major project will include at least 6,000 words of writing, or the equivalent amount of labour in another medium of your choice. The major project is worth 50% of your final mark.

I will mentor you in developing and executing this project—I will be a resource to you. Please visit my office early and often. In addition, we will have a series of structured activities over the course of the term that will help you develop and execute your project.

#### In-class activity & participation
The remaining 50% of your final mark compirses four marked components of in-class activity and participation. Three of these are pass/fail, or, more precisely, credit/no credit. You simply complete each of these to a reasonable degree of good faith effort, and you receive full credit:
* Serving as a guide (5% of final mark). Each student must serve as a guide at least once during the term. (More on this below.)
* Serving as a scribe (5% of final mark). Each student must serve as a scribe at least once during the term. (More on this below.)
* Completion of in-class group activities (20% of final mark). Each activity is pass-fail; there are nine activities scheduled for the term; each student is expected to complete 7 of these activities. This mark is the percentage of those seven which you complete.

In addition, I will asses a heuristic and wholistic evaluation of your participation in discussions (20% of final mark). I will offer you feedback on your class participation at mid-term so you may make course corrections.

#### Guides and scribes
Almost every class, two students will serve as guides, and two students will serve as scribes. (The first class, Scott will be the guide.)

##### Guides
Guides are responsible for asking two questions that will orient our discussion. These questions should not be deeply prepared; they should not demonstrate how smart you are. (Really!) They should be genuine, tied to the material in a concrete way, and should not have a factual answer. The two students should collaborate on questions. I do not expect these questions to take more than ten or fifteen minutes to come up with, although they should come after a close engagement with the reading.

##### Scribes
Each class period will have two scribes who will take notes for the entire session. They will refrain from participating in discussions (although they may ask questions whenever Scott forgets himself and starts lecturing). If you have accessibility accommodations that make note-taking difficult or impossible, discuss this with Scott to devise alternatives. 

### Course materials
This is _not_ a film studies course; it is a digital media studies course. If you know two things about digital media, you know about zeroes and ones, and you know that the computer is a “metamedium” that is able to contain, or remediate, or rework all other media. So we will watch some films (since that is our shared intellectual commitment), but we will also read literature, play video games, look at art of a few different kinds. If that doesn’t sound interesting to you, you should find your way into another seminar.

#### Readings
Course readings will come from three sources: required books, links to web materials, and PDFs distributed on our course Slack site. I have ordered the required books into the U of T bookstore: James Bridle’s _New Dark Age_ and Jenny Odell’s _How to Do Nothing_. Please purchase these ASAP—we have reading due from them even for the first class session.

Readings are crucial to this course; you must complete all assigned readings carefully before our class meetings on Monday.

#### Films
I have decided to shift our films this term away from narrative (so no _Ingrid Goes West_ or _The Social Network_ or _Eighth Grade_, all of which you should watch because they’re all great). This is because I have tried to minimize the levels of allegorization and mediation between our moving image material and the network. So we’re looking at documentary and experimental video art, mostly.

#### Other media
We’ll have many media other than film to encounter this term, from conceptual art through video games. I understand that most of you will have no formal training in how to think with these. This is fine, even great: the world demands you make sense of a great many things which you are not trained to analyze. One of the major lessons of this course will be in how to take your critical intuitions and skills honed on cinema and use them with other media forms.

#### Course technology
We are not using Quercus this term. Instead, materials will either be hosted in this GitHub repository, or in our Slack team: https://cin430f19.slack.com/. Anything that requires access control (readings shared under fair dealing rules, student work, etc.) will be hosted on Slack; anything that doesn’t will be shared here, on GitHub. Announcements will be broadcast on Slack. Students must sign up for the Slack team and should arrange their notification settings such that they will see @everyone announcements in #general in short order.

### Course schedule
The course schedule is available as a separate document [here](./schedule.md).

### Accessibility
I believe in making learning accessible to all students.

If you have accessibility needs, please discuss them with me (Scott) early and often. These can include mobility, affective, or cognitive accessibility issues. Some of these redound to the classroom environment, others to assessment.

#### Classroom environment
I aim for a fully accessible classroom environment. This covers a few areas.

##### Course materials
I aim to ensure all students can equally access course materials. Notes for class sessions will be posted shortly after class each week and will be publicly accessible. I will do what I can to make sure scanned readings are also accessible. I am not in principle opposed to audio recordings of our sessions, but if you would like to do so, I require that you ask the members of the seminar and that we come to consensus. In addition, I require that any recordings you make be made available to all members of the seminar through our Slack site.

##### Inclusion
I aim for radical inclusion of BIPOC, queer, trans, disabled, and otherwise marginalized students. This a regulative norm and not an actually-achievable goal. This means a few things. I will attempt to use language in ways that do not further promote marginalization. I will attempt to centre the experience and voice of marginalized groups, whenever possible. I will, inevitably, fail to live up to these goals. And so I will also always be open to discussions of how further to foster an environment of radical inclusion, either in or out of class. If you wish to discuss practices of inclusion with me, I am especially eager to have you visit me in my office. I promise you I will welcome your advice & insight.

##### The physical environment of the classroom
If you require any modifications to the classroom environment in order to be present and learn well in class, please communicate those needs early and often, by whatever means you have at your disposal. I mean this both very literally and very enthusiastically: I am left-handed and fat, so I know about not fitting into seats and not finding desks I can write at. I will work with you to do what we need to get you comfortable in your learning environments.
On laptops in the classroom.

This seems like a funny place to put this, but: laptops and other screens that change quickly (e.g. smartphones and iPads, but not Kindles) are highly distracting for others in the room. This really is an accessibility issue: futzing with your phone or surfing the web is polluting the shared space and impacting others' ability to learn. The ability to maintain focus in the face of distraction is not a given for people with cognitive or affective accessibility needs. If you wish to use a laptop in class—and I invite you to consider that you might want to less than you think you do!, as the internet is an ungovernable distraction device—please sit toward the rear of the auditorium, and keep your window-switching to a minimum. Consider also disabling distracting network connections, either by turning off your WiFi for the duration of class or by using a content-blocker such as [Freedom](https://freedom.to) to keep yourself away from Twitter or whatever it is you kids are using these days. Your affect, and your use of technology to manage that affect, affects others around you.

#### Course assessment
I am happy to modify the parameters of assessment—usually, but not always, by granting extensions—according to whatever accommodations students have worked out with Accessibility Services. However, I require that any student requesting accommodation discuss those accommodations with me, in person, **in the first two weeks of the class**, with the paperwork from Accessibility Services in hand.

That said, I recognize that not all students in situations warranting accommodation can get approved by accessibility services. If you wish to seek accommodation that has not been formally organized by Accessibility Services for any reason, please come talk to me about it as soon as you can.

If you have any reason to seek an extension that might be reasonably understood as an accessibility issue, even if it is temporary and you don't have paperwork from Accessibility Services, please contact me. Please be advised that I may well attach what I understand to be reasonable requirements to such one-off accessibility-based accommodations, such as obtaining a letter from your College Registrar. These requirements are mostly devised to ensure that you are connected to the relevant support services.

### Course policies
Here’s your typical policy boilerplate.

#### Attendance
Students must be present for at least 50% of class meetings to pass the course. I do not particularly take attendance. However, note that various bits of assessment (in-class activities and participation marks) require that students be physically present. These assignments may not be made up in any case. You have two “grace” activities; use them wisely.

#### 

#### What to call Scott
Scott. Not Professor. Not Professor Scott. Professor Richmond if you absolutely must inscribe our power relation in your address to me.

#### Getting in touch with Scott
Email is best, but a Slack DM also works. I try to respond to everything within 2 business days, but sometimes I fail. Please email me well in advance of any deadlines, since I really cannot make guarantees about email. If you have sent something to me for which you are expecting a response, once a week goes by, _please_ send me a reminder email. I will thank you for that reminder.

#### Academic dishonesty
The University of Toronto considers academic honesty and integrity to be important to your education. Any conduct that violates the University’s academic integrity standards will result in serious disciplinary action. For further details, please read the University’s policy, plus FAQs, at http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/.

##### To which Scott adds
If you are unsure of whether something constitutes plagiarism, please, for the love of George, ask me. I promise that the anxiety of asking is less than the anxiety of figuring out how to manage a plagiarism case. Also: for the love of Pete, blow through a deadline rather than copying-and-pasting things. At worst, I’ll be mildly annoyed at a missed deadline (I have missed so many deadlines in my life). At best, I’ll be _very, very disappointed_ in a plagiarism case. I’m a stickler for academic dishonesty. 

If you are panicking about making a deadline, the proper thing to do is to scream into your pillow, write an email to me that flays your soul open, delete that email, and then write me a brief, matter-of-fact email that includes the following bits and not a whisper more: (1) tell me you are going to miss a deadline; (2) tell me, _in not more than a single sentence,_ what has gone wrong (and if it is for accessibility reasons, simply say that); and (3) tell me when you are going to be able to get the work to me (and here, be generous with yourself; why flub two deadlines when you could be realistic and only miss one?). Note that this does not include an apology. I do not require or desire one. 

##### We will not use TurnItIn
That said, we will not be using any plagiarism-detection software this year, as it violates both a spirit of trust (I actually trust you) and [students' intellectual property rights](https://www.zdnet.com/article/turnitin-if-youre-a-student-all-your-intellectual-property-might-belong-to-us/) by monetizing their work.
