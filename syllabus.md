### Course description
Over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, a great many critics have despaired at the damage new media technologies do to our individual lives and to our collective life. The other side of this complaint is the promise of such new media technologies to offer more pleasurable, more optimistic, or simply better ways of living. This course tracks both sides of this dialectic historically and theoretically, in the hope of better understanding our contemporary entanglements in toxic media environments and cultures. To that end, we will pay particular attention to the recent burst of critical (and not-so-critical) writing about social media and internet use. Throughout, our focus will be less on the theoretical agendas of media critics than on the way theory can inform our sense of practical problems and prospects for better living; our reading will range across scholarly, pop-intellectual, and journalistic work. Our reading will be bookended by Theodor Adorno’s 1951 _Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life_ and James Bridle’s 2018 _New Dark Age_. Screenings and aesthetic texts will range widely across media and genres, including films, video art, literature, internet art, conceptual art, and video games.

### How this course is taught
This course pulls together a number of texts, films, artworks, and other objects that I have found useful for setting into focus and then describing the present conjuncture—of art, politics, culture, ordinary life, media technologies. And, living inside this present conjuncture feels really bad. This class represents a frank attempt to figure out how, and why, and what we might (and what I might) negotiate a less awful relationship to my media, which are at this point all digital and networked. 

I do not mean for the material I have pulled together to be exhaustive, and certainly not authoritative. The core critical intuition of this course is that none of us, not one, has a privileged position to address the current conjuncture. Because of that, this course will be rather more democratically driven than you are probably used to. At various critical moments in the course, we will ask ourselves whether what we have in front of us feels right, and whether we might want to pursue different kinds of questions, engage in different kinds of inquiry.

Because of all this, this course is decisively discussion-based, organized around student engagement with the material, and with each other. In other words, the way I understand my role here is to produce an occasion for all of us together to have a thought about our shared or unshared present, and the ways in which media technologies articulate those presents.

#### Discussions
The primary pedagogical activity this term will be group discussions. These discussions will be structured: each week, we will pose questions; use think-pair-share to lean into the question; collect some responses and observations; have a general discussion; and then reflect on the course of the discussion. We will have one or two of these per week, depending on the material we have at hand. This means that students **must** come with the reading carefully prepared each week, **and** with a playful willingness to reckon with the material collaboratively.

#### Group activities
In addition to discussions, most weeks we will also have a structured group activity that allows us to open up our questions in different registers than straightforward readings. In addition, these group activities will sometimes ask students to do “homework” in the ensuing week, with additional class time dedicated to addressing the results of that homework.

### Outcomes
The “outcomes” here stem from the same commiments as the pedagogical process. The learning activities in this coure are organized around encouraging students to do the following:
* To think, and think well, when it’s not clear how to proceed
* To develop tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty
* To develop skills for lateral thinking, drawing figures of thought from one domain into another
* To ask good questions
* To drive learning through engagement with intellectual problems
* To organize engagement with course material around what we don't know rather than what we do
* To unravel attachments to mastery
* To have vulnerable discussions
* To develop analytical, aesthetic and conceptual skill with media other than film
* To trust process, not outcome

### Coursework
The coursework is divided in two different streams: (1) in-class & activity participation, and (2) a major project.

#### Major project
The major project will be completely bespoke. You will devise your own problem, and your own methods of responding to that problem. All parameters are to be determined (in one of our group activities), but your major project will include at least 6,000 words of writing, or the equivalent amount of labour in another medium of your choice. The major project is worth 50% of your final mark.

#### In-class activity & participation
The remaining 50% of your final mark compirses four marked components of in-class activity and participation. Three of these are pass-fail:
* Serving as a guide (5% of final mark). Each student must serve as a guide at least once during the term.
* Serving as a scribe (5% of final mark). Each student must serve as a scribe at least once during the term.
* Completion of in-class group activities (20% of final mark). Each activity is pass-fail; there are nine activities; each student is expected to complete 7 of these activities. This mark is the percentage of those seven which you complete. (For those of you interestd in counting individual points, each completed activity is ~14.3% of this mark.)

In addition, I will asses a heuristic and wholistic evaluation of your participation in discussions (20% of final mark).
