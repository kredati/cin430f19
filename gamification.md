# Gamify your life!
## Due in class Monday, Nov. 11

Your "group work" assignment between October 28 and November 11 is to gamify some aspect of your life. Here are the rules to the game of making a game:

1. You must find some activity that you do reasonably frequently (at least a few times a week) that is countable in a meaningful way. It does not, in fact, have to be something you want, or don't want, or meta-want to do: just something that you can count.
2. You must attach to this activity a point scoring system.
3. You must have some "reward" for points: leveling up, rewards (virtual or actual), stickers, etc.
4. You must have some kind of "scoreboard" that documents the points and rewards that you can hand in to Scott.
5. You must also engage in some kind of brief reflective writing that meditates on this activity and its transformation or modulation around gamification: how you feel about it differently; a change in frequency, or motivation; and so on.
