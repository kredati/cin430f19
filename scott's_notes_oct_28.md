# Scott's notes
## October 28

* People speaking for other people during "I wonder what you talked about?"
* Katie: Points, quantification, and meaningfulness.
* Patrick: What do mean by meaning? Productivity (again quantification).
* Cassandra: Points & quantification as being about comfort, accomplishment.

(What is the psychology of accomlishment, justification, etc.? What would it mean to feel comfortable in a contribution or a way of living that isn't proved? Likewise, what are the ways in which people are accorded status [justification] without quantifiable contribution?)

* Patrick: Can there be a game without rewards? Rewards = cut scene, leveling up, $$$
* Patrick & Cassandra: What is a game, anyway? This question moves quickly to: What is the pleasure of gaming?

(Scott wants to know: What are the ways of coming up with answers to this question? Patrick has this figure for childhood games, e.g. tag. So we have examples that we have in common. Nobody turns to reading.)

We're moving towards differentiating tag or hide & seek and digital games.

* Lara, once again, brings up Club Penguin. Scott remains ignorant of Club Penguin.
* Cassandra, re: Red Dead Redemption, Patrick & Katie re: The Sims: are there ways of playing "open world" games (however broadly you mean that) that delaminate play from goals.
* Alex: Also, you can destroy all the things—The Sims can be about how bad things (how bad you) can get.
* Yazmeen: What is the realism of _SPENT_? A forcing mechanism to take up a particular avatar. But _SPENT_ gamifies poverty empathy.

I've noted the discussion is moving along in a lively way, but we're also apparently moving away from the question.

* Patrick: Pulls out Yazmeen's point about cheating: couldn't cheating be a form of counter-gaming?
* Victoria: That would depend on motivation.
* Cassandra: Regarding motivation, can we think of _Journey_ as competitive? "Competitive chirping."

How do we think about intent & motivation in gaming? What are the intentions that we form in play, in gaming?

* Alex, Patrick: Can we gamify Odell's rose garden?
* Raval: What would radical gaming mechanics look like, and how could they be "gamified"?
* Patrick: We don't seem to like _SPENT_. What would a better _SPENT_ look like?
* Raval: What if we do away with a goal? So what would _SPENT_ look like if we take away the goal.
* [...]: What if the game was a total boss: told you everything you should do.
* Raval: So let's think about _The Stanley Parable_: it tells you how to progress, but also gives you the opportunity to depart.

* Brandon, Patrick: "What if we do this _in bad faith_?"

Faithfulness as a problem: how do we do (and do not) bear faith to a game (to a medium: cf. Bazin).

* Tasha: Can "radical games" be designed into games? Or can games only be radicalized by the people playing the games. (Yes! This is the rub.)
* Patrick: You can't break a film.
* Alex: This situates the game against the developer, play becomes antagonism between the player and the developers.
* Victoria: Isn't this about hacking. Cf. Doctorow and the toaster.

Also: cf. Galloway, "Networks": intra-anti-network politics.

* Patrick, Rachel: What if games were about training us to "hijack" capitalism—playing against the developers is training not in capitalism but in revolution.
* Cassandra: But aren't you still "playing the game"?
* Lara: Perhaps the only way to win is not to play. (cf. _War Games_)
* Lara & Patrick: Rules can always be changed; cf. Calvinball where the rules become the game. (Also 1000 Blank White Cards.)
* Cassandra & Patrick: Could radical games be made of software? Is this like modding?
* Victoria: But this "radical game" sounds just like Deleuze and the constant modulation of control: the rules can always change, but you're still subject to them. (Yes! This is another rub.)
* Patrick: Is this more like games being constantly patched (cf. Dota 2)?
* Patrick: As a creator, does this mean you just can't create a game that is radical like this?
* Victoria: If players are constantly working on the rules, doesn't this confuse games and creators?

Cf. Galloway, Nam June Paik, Yoko Ono, Lamonte Young: musicians whose most important move is to stop making "playable" scores. This set of questions has played out in music in the midcentury.
