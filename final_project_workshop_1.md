# Final Project Workshop the first
## Developing some guidelines

This document is a guided activity that walks students through the process of considering, discussing, and getting started working on their final project for “Everything is Terrible.”

### Some structures and rules
First, what Scott has set out:

#### Size, scope, and genre
First, from the course syllabus:

> The major project will be completely bespoke: what you do will be _entirely_ up to you, so long as it is within the horizons of the course. You will devise your own problem, and your own methods of responding to that problem. All parameters are to be determined (in one of our group activities), but your major project will include at least 6,000 words of writing, or the equivalent amount of labour in another medium of your choice. The major project is worth 50% of your final mark.

> I will mentor you in developing and executing this project—I will be a resource to you. Please visit my office early and often. In addition, we will have a series of structured activities over the course of the term that will help you develop and execute your project.

#### Additional guidance
* Your final project should employ, to some substantive effect, the kinds of skills you have developed in your career as a cinema studies student. That means historical contextualization, formal analysis, critical description, theoretical speculation, and so on. It need not employ _all_ of these, but it must employ at least one.
* That said, your final project should have an intentional relationship to its form. Whatever form it takes (a series of blog posts, a curated online exhibition, a research paper, creative work of some kind, etc.), you should have a _reason_ for its form, and the reason for this form should be reasonably clear internally to the project.
* Your project should be more focused than you’re imagining right now. Specificity is the hallmark of good humanistic work.

#### We have a process
* Process matters: your final project will have several intermediate steps. We have two times set aside in class to work on projects together. These are:
  - November 11
  - November 25
  - December 5 (listed in the syllabus as Standups/Works-in-progress)
* Final projects are due (technically) on December 5, but the whole class gets a blanket extension until December 9, at 3pm (the beginning of our class time together).

### Your task, today
You have several tasks today:
1. **Get started on your project.** Part of today’s activity is just a guided activity to get a handle on your projects.

### Activity the first: get some paper, or open a document on your computer.

### Activity the first: accumulate topics
Spend the next three minutes writing down things that are especially interesting to you. Think about: What websites/apps/corners of the internet do you frequently visit? What do you do there? How do they make you feel? What do you do to help yourself feel better when the world feels overwhelming? What makes you really, really angry? Depressed? What confuses you about the internet? The idea here is something like brainstorming. Once you have a list of things, select three terms, or clusters of terms—sites, apps, feelings, activities, etc.—that you feel especially jazzed about, that capture something around your particular interests/questions/concerns about the internet, computation, contemporary life insofar as it is lived in intimate relation to computation.

### Activity the second: freewrite
We’ll do three different different free writes, one for each of the above terms (or clusters). Each of these will begin with one of the following phrases:
* “The reason I am interested in x is”
* “What I don’t understand about x is”
* “What I hope to understand about x is”

The idea here is that you have to write for five minutes each, _without stopping_. This will be _very_ difficult. Be as disinhibited as you can muster.

### Activity the third: identify key terms
In _all three_ of the freewrites, look for words that show up more than once. Write these down, make tickmarks next to them. Group them into clusters of related terms.

### Activity the fourth: form these into a topic and a question
Those of you who have taken CIN301 with me will have some familiarity with this particular format. Using at least three (perhaps more) of the key terms above, state your topic and pose a question about it. Try out the following format, “I am working on {topic}, because I want to find out {question}.”

### Activity the fifth: refine the question
Pair with a neighbour. Then, see if you can’t make the questions more precise, the topics more specific. Is the question adequately addressed to the topic? Will the topic support the question?

Also, pay particular attention to what your archive might be here: what material will you turn to in pursuing your question? What apps, sites, films, experiences, artworks, etc., will let you work on your question?

### Activity the sixth: a volunteer (or two) submit(s) their question to the group
Depending on time, we’ll workshop some of these topics and questions.

### Activity the seventh: your agenda moving forward
This isn’t necessarily going to be your final paper topic and question; you will keep working on this. This is a process for working out some of that. Here are some next steps:
* Identify a _problem_ (à la Wayne Booth), which is what help an answer to your question would give somebody. Normally, in academic work, that help is “understanding something better.” But in this case, you could take a much, much broader, weirder, or unusual tack. Also, who that “somebody” is really matters. So:
* Identify your _audience_. Consider who your audience is, who you’d like to help. Notionally, it’s everybody else in the classroom, but it could be any group of people.
* Continue to refine your topics and questions, making them more specific.
* Or, re-do this process liberally a few times to see what pops out at you. And then consider your several topic/question pairs together, to see what stands out.
